# anti_young_brother_program
This is an application built with PyQt6 that allows you to terminate (kill) specific programs or processes. You can add program names to the application, and it will stop them automatically within a specified time range (between 10 and 1000 seconds). This time range can be adjusted through the GUI.
The application starts hidden by default.
To show it, go to the system tray, find the application icon (e.g. PyCharm icon), right-click it, and select "Show Window".
You can press Ctrl+F12 at any time to hide it.
